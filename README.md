Objects can all be parented to a single empty, or for each of the selected objects the own empty created and, the object is parented to it.

You can keep transformations (location, rotation, and scale) of the parented objects, or transfer them to the parent empty. In this case, an empty is always created at the origin of the object.

The "Remove parent Empty" button removes parenting to empty and deletes it from the scene.

Pressing the "Collection to Parent Empty" button converts the currently active collection into objects parented to the empty. "Parent Empty to Collection" converts the parent empty to the collection.
